      <h3> Learn More About Me </h3>
        <p> I am passionate about continuing to learn new skills that can help me better myself and become more competitive in the job market. I have been doing sales for most of my adult life and would like a change. I feel that learning to code will both challenge me mentally and creatively and will be an exciting new career path. I am looking forward to this journey of learning and hope to be proficient enough to change careers within a years time but I understand that this bar may be set too high however I look forward to the hard work and new skills that await.</p>

          <h3> My Skills </h3>
            <p> I have just begun to learn coding so my skillset is relatviely weak. I have been learning HTML, CSS, Javascript and Python. I will continue to focus on this as well as branch out into other languages once I feel I have a strong understanding of the languages I am currently studying. Eventually I would like to be a Full Stack Developer. </p>
